                    Now that the hype for Barbenheimer has died down since the very anticipated release in July, I have one question: How was it so successful? Answer: So much marketing. With any blockbuster hit, it comes with a lot of press and advertising. I think Barbie hit great marks for its advertising before and after release leading to its financial success. But also, who doesn’t love Barbie?

This movie has been heavily anticipated prior to its trailer release earlier this year, but after its trailer release is when the marketing started getting pushed out. Starting with the main movie poster of Margot Robbie as Barbie taking up majority of the poster and Ryan Gosling as Ken as a small piece of the poster with the tag line: ‘She’s everything, he’s just Ken’

The initial ads for the movie is great because it sets the tone/brand for the movie as comedic, witty and pink. Not only that but there were a lot of people spinning the poster into their own parodies and posting it to social media that gave more reach and building a fan base before the movie came out. 

Another aspect to the anticipation to Barbie and it was Oppenheimer, the biopic of Robert J Oppenheimer, inventor of the atomic bomb that ended WWII. There was this ‘competition’ between the two of which is the movie to see. It led to viewers to watching both movies on the same day (me included).

From the movie soundtrack to dressing up in pink to the theater, the movie was heavily advertised and talked about.

Overall, Barbie like any blockbuster movie requires advertising and press tours. This is an important aspect in profits and gaining more viewers. But Barbie definitely had a strong marketing campaign because they leaned into a brand that perfectly matches the movie and was able to gather a strong fanbase.

                    Tekken is a 1v1 fighting game developed by Bandai Namco. Each character has its own rage move that gives the most damage to their opponent. And as I kept playing the game I noticed how each player fights and keeping note of their strengths and weaknesses. This was my favorite video game growing up, and following the lore of this game was also very entertaining.  Listed below are my top three players. The criteria I used to rank the characters is not only their stats and moves, but how interesting their backstory is and how it unfolds in the game.
                </p> 
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Alisa - She is the most mobility and very agile. She also has the most unique features and abilities. This is an optimal choice if the user knows her controls well. Not only her abilities, her backstory is the most interesting because she is a cyborg with amnesia and trying to restore her memory. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Law - He has the most win rate over all characters. He is a martial artist, inspired by Bruce Lee and has different fighting styles than the other characters
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Akuma - He is the most powerful character with maxed out level of combo damage and wall carry. He also has the highest win rate over all characters.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
