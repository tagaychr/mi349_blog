                <p>Hi there, I'm Christina Tagay, a fourth year college student with a passion for web development. ðŸŽ“ðŸ’»</p>

                <p>Currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science, I've always been drawn to the world of coding and web design and it has sparked my interest to become a full stack developer.</p>

                <p>During my college journey, I've taken all the relevant courses from introductory Python courses, algorithms and data structures course, and now in web development courses. Outside of class, I'm involved in extracurriculars that include web development and coding. From creating interactive web applications to ensuring responsive designs, I find joy in every step of the development process.</p>

                <p>Here are some of the web technologies I'm proficient in:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>HTML and CSS</li>
                    <li>JavaScript</li>
                    <li>UX Design</li>
                    <li>Git</li>
                </ul>

                <p>My ultimate goal is to make the web a better place, one website at a time. I'm excited about the potential of technology to bring about positive change and enhance the user experience. </p>

                <p>If you share my enthusiasm for web development, have any questions, or just want to connect, feel free to reach out!</p>
